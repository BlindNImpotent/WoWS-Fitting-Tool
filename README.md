## Payment, Ads and trackers
I'm paying everything (server, domain, etc) out of my pocket so there's absolutely **no payment or ads**. There is Google Analytics tracker and Tawk.to chat service, but those are for monitoring traffics and to receive user feedbacks faster. I intend to keep it this way for as long as I can afford to do so.
