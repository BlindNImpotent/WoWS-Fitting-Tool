The German battleship Bismarck, under the command of Admiral Lütjens, and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen went out to sea to break into the Atlantic and attack British shipping lines. On 20 May, the neutral Swedish cruiser Gotland spotted the German ships. The British Admiralty learned of this through intelligence channels. The next day, the Royal Navy commanders received a photograph of the raid ships berthing in one of the Norwegian fiords and started regrouping their forces for interception. Bismarck and Prinz Eugen tried to break into the Atlantic, sailing round Iceland in the North. British forces were already waiting for them in the Denmark Strait. On the evening of 23 May, the cruiser Suffolk established radar contact with the German ships. After a while, Bismarck shelled the cruiser Norfolk, commencing fire at the enemy ship from the main battery guns. Norfolk managed to avoid disastrous hits and hid behind a smoke screen.",
  "IDS_PCQM042_DESCR": "At the end of 23 May, the heavy British cruisers Norfolk and Suffolk steamed behind the German ships and continued to surveil them, avoiding their visibility range. Information about the location, course and speed of the raiders was passed to the Home Fleet Commander Admiral Tovey. Two ships under command of the Vice-Admiral Holland were sailing ahead to intercept the Germans: the battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser HMS Hood, the pride of Great Britain's Navy. On the dawn of 24 May, Lütjens' and Holland's ships met at the mouth of the Denmark Strait. The British started firing. Within the first six minutes, Prince of Wales hit Bismarck three times. The fifth salvo from the German battleship struck HMS Hood and caused the detonation of her magazine. After a horrible explosion, \"Mighty Hood\" was sunk with most of her crew. ",
  "IDS_PCQM043_DESCR": "After HMS Hood's wreckage on the morning of 24 May, the battle in the Denmark Strait continued. Prince of Wales was left alone under the concentrated fire of the German ships. Their shells struck the English battleship one by one. HMS Prince of Wales, which had joined the fleet a few weeks earlier, found herself in the thick of the action. She hadn't finished the battle training cycle, and some of her guns and systems broke down from time to time. Eventually, the distance between the opponents was short enough to use secondary battery guns and the Germans were about to attack the target with torpedoes. The Prince of Wales Commander gave the order to use smoke and turn away, as only two main battery guns were operational and the risk of losing the ship was very high. Only then, HMS Suffolk reached the battlefield and was able to fire a few salvos in the direction of the German flagship.",
  "IDS_PCQM044_DESCR": "The naval battle on 24 May ended with a convincing victory for the German fleet. Though, Bismarck was seriously damaged. A number of compartments were flooded, the ship speed was decreased, the catapult was broken, and the steaming distance was significantly decreased due to damaged fuel tanks. This condition didn't allow for further raiding on ocean communications, and the battleship Commander decided to set a course for a port in occupied France. Covering the cruiser Prinz Eugen breaking to the Atlantic, on the evening of 24 May, Bismarck engaged her pursuers – the battleship HMS Prince of Wales, cruisers HMS Norfolk and HMS Suffolk. As a result, the British forces let Prinz Eugen slip by. Meanwhile, after receiving the news about the battlecruiser HMS Hood wreckage, the Home Fleet commanders decided to concentrate on intercepting the raiders of all forces: about fifty ships, including two aircraft carriers and a few battleships. Overnight, into 25 May, Bismarck was attacked by aircraft from the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious and was hit by a torpedo. The damage to the ship became more extensive.",
  "IDS_PCQM045_DESCR": "On the dawn on 25 May, Bismarck managed to outmaneuver the enemy ships, left the British radar coverage area, and set a course for France. Britain's forces started searching for the battleship, using reconnaissance planes from the shore bases and aircraft carriers. Despite all their efforts, they didn't find any signs of Bismarck as it moved toward the base for more than a day. Only on the morning of 26 May, a flying boat Consolidated PBY Catalina spotted the battleship. The main forces of the Home Fleet were far behind. Only Force H, which started its pursuit three days earlier, could intercept the raider. The cruiser HMS Sheffield, which detected the location of the German battleship, passed the coordinates to the torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier Ark Royal. One of the three torpedoes that hit Bismarck disabled her steering gear and thus determined the ship's fate.",
  "IDS_PCQM046_DESCR": "As darkness fell on 26 May, Bismarck, with her damaged steering gear, managed to hit the cruiser HMS Sheffield with a few salvos, and forced her to retreat hurriedly. However, Captain Vian's group of destroyers arrived on the battlefield. One of them, the Polish destroyer ORP Piorun that first detected the enemy, engaged her alone. Several salvos from the 380 mm guns forced the heroic destroyer to retreat. Meanwhile, Captain Vian's group of destroyers surrounded Bismarck and tried to hit her with torpedoes. Throughout the night of 26-27 May, the destroyers HMS Cossack, HMS Sikh, HMS Maori and HMS Zulu attacked the damaged battleship several times. Bismarck was barely avoiding torpedoes while firing back with all guns. Darkness and turbulent waters played into the German's hands and allowed them to avoid any further damage.",
  "IDS_PCQM047_DESCR": "Captain Vian's destroyers fulfilled their task. They exhausted the crew on the German battleship and directed the main forces of the Home Fleet to the target. On the morning of 27 May, Bismarck was spotted by the battleships King George V and Rodney. Salvos from the Germans were accurate, but the British were more so. They quickly disabled the forward guns on the German battleship and destroyed the main fire control director. Eventually, two heavy British cruisers joined the battle. In addition to their main battery guns, the English opened fire with their dual-purpose guns and torpedoes. One torpedo from Rodney struck Bismarck. Once all German guns were put out of action, the English battleships started firing at Bismarck at close range. Torpedo bombers that flied off the aircraft carrier Ark Royal for a new attack held back, as the battle outcome was already decided. Finally, the cruiser Dorsetshire sank the unlucky raider with a pair of torpedoes.",

  "IDS_PCZC011_BISMARCK_BISMARCK_DESCRIPTION": "The badge of the German battleship Bismarck (first commissioned in 1940) originates from the family Coat of Arms of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck whose name the ship bears. \n\nDuring her only naval operation, Bismarck, escorted by the cruiser Prinz Eugen, was to break through into the Atlantic to attack Allied convoys, but the secretive dash did not go unnoticed: the ships were spotted and later intercepted by the British. On 24 May, in the Denmark Strait, a shell from Bismarck struck the British battlecruiser HMS Hood and the ship exploded. However, Bismarck, too, was damaged and had to abandon her breakthrough mission. On 26-27 May, the combined forces of the Royal Navy, backed by aviation, immobilized Bismarck and sank her with artillery fire.",

The ship's badge includes elements from the emblem of the famous Prince Eugene of Savoy, the Austrian commander of the late 17th–early 18th centuries, whose name the ship bears. \n\nDuring the Exercise Rhine (May 1941), the cruiser was to escort Bismarck during the breakthrough into the Atlantic to block Allied shipping. On 24 May, Prinz Eugen was brought to action along with the battleship in the Denmark Strait, following which she detached from Bismarck to go on a solo raid, but it brought no results. ",

The British Intelligence Service obtained that information and passed it to the Admiralty in London, which is when the hunt for the battleship began.",
